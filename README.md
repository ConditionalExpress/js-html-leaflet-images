# javascript html leaflet images

Displays the geolocation from the selected image (by click) on the map.
I used a csv input variable created by exiftool and a <img> element for all images.
The csv input is converted into json object.

The pictures (copyright by myself) are from the last bicycle tour in Danmark.
